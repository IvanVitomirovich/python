Only turnin' up for the squadron
Shinin' 'round here, we gotta rob them
Bullets 'round here, we gotta dodge them
Stackin' up paper for the problems
Odds stacked up, see the odds then
We don't ever end up Steve Jobs then
We don't ever barely get jobs then
Georgetown massa goin' often
Throw it up for the squadron
